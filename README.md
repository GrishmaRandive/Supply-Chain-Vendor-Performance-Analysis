# Description & Purpose
This project presents a Power BI dashboard to monitor and evaluate supplier performance across key supply chain metrics. The goal is to support procurement and operations teams in making data-driven decisions around supplier reliability, cost control, and quality management.

# Tools & Skills Used
Power BI, SQL, DAX Measures, Data Modeling, Data Visualization, Reporting, KPI Analysis, Spend Analysis.

# Dashboard Highlights
•Vendor Scorecard – Evaluate suppliers on on-time %, lead time, defects, spend, and savings •Category Insights – Identify high-cost or high-defect product categories •Monthly Trends – Track improvements or declines in performance over time •KPI Tiles – Key metrics such as total spend, defect rate, and on-time delivery count •Dynamic Filters – Analyze data by supplier or category

# Business Questions Answered
•Which suppliers are most reliable in delivery and quality? •What categories contribute the most to cost or quality issues? •How much has been saved through negotiated pricing? •Is supplier performance improving over time?

# Insights & Final Recommendations___
# Key Insights:
•On-time delivery is low across vendors (26–34%), suggesting inefficiencies. •Some suppliers show high defect rates (up to 18%). •MRO and Office Supplies are the top spend categories (~₹11M each). •Negotiated savings are visible but underutilized. •Delivery performance improved marginally in later months.

# Recommendations:
1.Replace or review underperforming suppliers. 2.Enforce performance-based SLAs. 3.Leverage high-spend suppliers for better pricing. 4.Use dashboard monthly to track and act on supplier KPIs.
